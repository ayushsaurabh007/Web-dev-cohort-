# More on networking 

## OSI model 
- __Physical Layer__ This layer is the most basic layer . Its work is to transfer files and its content over physical medium . Organises data into frames . 

- __Data Link Layer__ This layer sits on top of the physical layer and its main funciton is *node to node data transfer and error detection* .  Organises data into frames 

- __Network Layer__ Handles logical addresing routing of the packets that are made . Defines IP address that helps in reliable transfer . Fragmentation and reassebly of the packets .

- __Transport Layer__  Ensures end to end communication and data delivery between devices . Segmentation and reassembly of data , flow control and error detection 

- __Session Layer__ Manages and controls communication . Establish and maintain and terminates sessions .

- __Presentation Layer__ Ensures data is in a readable format for the application on layer . It mainly has 3 function encryption , compression , translation .

- __Application Layer__ This layer is responsible for human computer interation . It works as an interface between computer and interface .


## What is IP address 
 IP is a unique numerical label assigned to devices connected to network that uses the internet protocol for communication . 

 ### Purpose 
 - Identification : Identify any device on a network 
 - Specifies the location of the device within the network
